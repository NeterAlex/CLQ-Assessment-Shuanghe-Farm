# CLQ-Assessment-Shuanghe-Farm

This repository contains the official **Code** and **subset data** for the paper: *"Research on Cultivated Land Quality Assessment at the Farm Scale for Black Soil Region in Northeast China Based on Typical Periods Remote Sensing Images from Landsat 9"*.

## Overview

This project proposes a novel deep learning framework, **BO-Stacking-TabNet**, to assess Cultivated Land Quality (CLQ) directly from raw multi-temporal spectral reflectance data from Landsat 9, achieving high accuracy and reliability at the farm scale.

## Dataset

The dataset provided (`subset_data.csv`) is a public subset containing **424 anonymized land parcels** from the Shuanghe Farm study area. This subset is representative and covers all CLQ grades to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments.
