Code and data for the paper 'Research on Cultivated Land Quality Assessment.
Cultivated Land Quality Assessment using BO-Stacking-TabNet
This repository contains the official implementation and a public data subset for the paper: "Research on Cultivated Land Quality Assessment at the Farm Scale for Black Soil Region in Northeast China Based on Typical Periods Remote Sensing Images from Landsat 9".

This project proposes a novel deep learning framework, BO-Stacking-TabNet, to assess Cultivated Land Quality (CLQ) directly from raw multi-temporal spectral reflectance data from Landsat 9, achieving high accuracy and reliability at the farm scale.

Dataset
The dataset provided (shuanghe_farm_subset.csv) is a public subset containing 424 anonymized land parcels from the Shuanghe Farm study area. This subset is representative and covers all CLQ grades to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments.
